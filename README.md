# hyperskill-tic-tac-toe
### My Tic Tac Toe project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #4

**About:** A Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. The program allows playing the game for two players against each other by entering the cell coordinates. Since the game is in a loop, the game is only ended when one of the players wins or if it is a draw. The program has the capacity to analyze each move for the correctness and show the current game field. In error cases (the cell is not empty; the user does not enter two integers; the user goes beyond the field), the program prints an appropriate message for the user and prompts to enter the coordinates again.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about using functions, escape sequences, handling errors, and processing user input in Python. This project also allowed me to use my skills of planning and developing a more complex program from scratch and slowly adding more functionality. I learnt to utilize list comprehension, nested lists, various strings methods such as split, join, any, all, etc. which were especially useful in solving more challenging exercises, and making the code shorter and neater. I have also gained knowledge of scopes in Python, specifically the LEGB rule.

**FIY:** The coordinates of the game field:  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)
