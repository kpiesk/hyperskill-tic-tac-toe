# hyperskill-python-tic-tac-toe
### My Tic Tac Toe project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #4

**About:** A Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. The program allows playing the game for two players against each other by entering the cell coordinates. Since the game is in a loop, the game is only ended when one of the players wins or if it is a draw. The program has the capacity to analyze each move for the correctness and show the current game field. In error cases (the cell is not empty; the user does not enter two integers; the user goes beyond the field), the program prints an appropriate message for the user and prompts to enter the coordinates again.

**FIY:** The coordinates of the game field:  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)
